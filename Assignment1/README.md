# Assignment 1

In this assignment, a OFDM system is simulated for 4-QAM, 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM constellations in the presence of an AWGN channel and the variation of BER with SNR is studied.

## Contents 

## OFDM_ideal.m 

A matlab file that simulates the necessary system and produces a comparison of the theoretical and practical curves. The extent of timing offset, the CP length and the nubmer of useful subcarriers can be adjusted within the script.

### Output

- A plot of the theoretical and practical waterfall curves for a AWGN, single tap channel
